# Customers clustering
## Description
In this project i've tried to show the use of unsupervised learning in businesses for potential improving KPI's.\
You can see my [notebook](https://github.com/Egor-Cherevan/Customers_clustering/blob/main/Notebook/Customers_segmentation%20.ipynb) if it's more convenient than [code](https://github.com/Egor-Cherevan/Customers_clustering/blob/main/code.py) for you.
## Data
I've used the [Mall Customers dataset](https://github.com/Egor-Cherevan/Customers_clustering/blob/main/mall_customers.csv) as a train dataset. It consist of 5 features:
1.  CustomerID - It is the unique ID assigned to the customer
2.  Gender - Customers gender
3.  Age - Customers age(years)
4.  Annual Income(k$) - Customers annual income in k$
5.  Spending Score (1-100) - Customers score assigned by the mall based on the customer behavior
## Structure of project
1.  Importing the libraries
2.  Loading the data
3.  Primary analysis
4.  Scaling
5.  Primary clustering
6.  Simple analysis of clastering
7.  Models optimization
8.  Viewing the data without scaling divided into groups
9.  Descriptive statistics for clusters
10.  Definition the most useful group of customers for mall
## Conclusions
Using clustering can enable companies to build personal relationships with customers and work better with them. An individual approach to each client can increase customer loyalty and ensure increased profits.
