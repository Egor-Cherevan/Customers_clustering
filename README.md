# Customers_clustering
## Data
I've used the [Mall Customers dataset](https://github.com/Egor-Cherevan/Customers_clustering/blob/main/mall_customers.csv) as a train dataset.
It consist of 5 features:
1.  CustomerID - It is the unique ID assigned to the customer
2.  Gender - Customers gender
3.  Age - Customers age(years)
4.  Annual Income(k$) - Customers annual income in k$
5.  Spending Score (1-100) - Customers score assigned by the mall based on the customer behavior.
